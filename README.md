## Description
README-Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Upon invoking the application using the command "node index.js", users are directed through a series of prompts pertaining to each section of a quality README. Users enter their inputs & selections accordingly and are then presented with a newly-created README.md file specific to their application. This allows a developer to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README. 

## Installation
This application requires the following node modules:
* Inquirer
* FS

To install, run "npm install" in your Command Line System.

## Usage
To use this application, run "node index.js" in your Command Line System and navigate through the prompts accordingly.
